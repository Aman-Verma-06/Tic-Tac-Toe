Description:

This project is a Tic Tac Toe game developed using React. It allows two players to compete against each other in the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. The application provides a simple and intuitive interface for playing the game, with visual feedback on game status and winner declaration.

Features:

Two-Player Gameplay: Two players can take turns to play the game, one after the other.

Interactive Board: Users can click on empty cells on the board to place their moves (X or O).

Win Detection: The application detects when a player has won the game by getting three of their marks (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal.

Draw Detection: The application detects when the game ends in a draw (tie) if there are no more empty cells on the board and no player has won.

Game Reset: After the game ends (either by a win or draw), players can reset the game to play again.

Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive and work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.
